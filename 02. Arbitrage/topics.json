        "An arbitrage opportunity is defined as a self-financing strategy where the final value is non-negative almost surely (P-a.s.) and has a positive probability of being strictly positive, indicating the possibility of making a risk-free profit. This concept is central to financial market theory, highlighting the potential for exploiting price discrepancies.",
        "No-Arbitrage (NA) conditions, such as NA+ and NA', ensure that it is impossible to generate something from nothing using admissible or all self-financing strategies, respectively. These conditions are crucial for ensuring market rationality and preventing strategies that guarantee profit without risk, with distinctions becoming important in continuous time or infinite time horizons.",
        "A market S is arbitrage-free if there exists no self-financing strategy with zero initial wealth such that VT (') >= 0 P-a.s. and P[VT (') > 0] > 0. The space G0 represents all final wealths that can be generated from zero initial wealth through self-financing trading strategies.",
        "A probability measure Q is equivalent to P (Q \u2248 P) if they share the same nullsets in F, meaning they agree on what is possible or impossible, even if their quantitative assessments differ. This equivalence is crucial for risk-neutral pricing and changing between probability measures.",
        "Lemma 1.2 states that if there exists a probability measure Q \u2248 P under which the asset price S is a Q-martingale, then the market is arbitrage-free, linking martingale properties to market efficiency.",
        "The Equivalent Martingale Measure (EMM) is a probability measure Q \u2248 P such that the discounted asset price S is a Q-martingale, which is fundamental for pricing derivatives in a risk-neutral world.",
        "An equivalent (local) martingale measure (E(L)MM) for S is a probability measure Q equivalent to P on FT such that S is a (local) Q-martingale, denoted by IP(S) or IPe, and its existence is equivalent to the absence of arbitrage, as stated by the Dalang/Morton/Willinger theorem.",
        "The Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing (FTAP) states that a financial market is arbitrage-free if and only if there exists an equivalent martingale measure (EMM) for the asset price process, providing a mathematical foundation for arbitrage-free pricing. This translates the economic/financial condition of absence of arbitrage into an equivalent, purely mathematical/probabilistic condition, opening the door for the use of martingale theory in financial market models.",
        "The condition y1 < r < ym implies that the riskless interest rate r lies strictly between the smallest and largest return values y1 and ym, indicating that the stock S\u00b9 has the potential for both higher and lower growth than the riskless bank account S\u2070, making it genuinely riskier.",
        "The Radon-Nikod\u00fdm theorem ensures the existence of a density process D > 0 such that Q[A] = EP[DIA] for all events A, allowing us to switch between expectations under different probability measures, which is essential for pricing and hedging.",
        "The Bayes formula provides a way to update conditional expectations when changing from one probability measure to another, which is crucial for dynamic asset pricing and risk management.",
        "Risk-Neutral Valuation is the principle that assets can be priced by taking the expected value of their future payoffs, discounted at the risk-free rate, under a risk-neutral probability measure.",
        "Change of Measure Technique is a methodology that involves altering the probability measure to simplify the pricing and hedging of derivatives, particularly useful when dealing with complex stochastic processes."

        "Equivalent martingale measures (EMMs) play a crucial role in mathematical finance, particularly in option pricing and hedging, by relating computations and probabilistic properties under different probability measures Q and P, where Q \u2248 P.",
        "The Radon-Nikod\u00fdm theorem states that if Q \u2248 P, there exists a density dQ/dP = D, where D > 0 P-a.s., such that Q[A] = EP[DIA] for all A \u2208 F, allowing computation of Q-expectations in terms of P-expectations and vice versa.",
        "The P-martingale Z (density process) is defined as Zk := EP[D|Fk] = EP[dQ/dP | Fk] for k = 0, 1, ..., T, where D is the density of Q with respect to P on F. It is strictly positive and called the density process of Q with respect to P, serving as a transformation rule for conditional expectations.",
        "Lemma 3.1 states that for every k \u2208 {0, 1, ..., T} and any A \u2208 Fk, Q[A] = EP[ZKIA], linking probabilities under Q and P.",
        "Bayes' Formula in Measure Transformation provides a way to transform conditional expectations from the real-world measure P to the risk-neutral measure Q, using the density process, enabling the computation of option prices and hedge ratios under the risk-neutral measure. The Bayes formula (3.2) provides a way to relate conditional expectations under Q and P: EQ[Uk | Fj] = (1/Zj) * EP[ZkUk | Fj] Q-a.s.",
        "A process N = (Nk)k=0,1,...,T adapted to F is a Q-martingale if and only if the product ZN is a P-martingale, illustrating how martingale properties are related under P and Q. This links martingale properties under different measures and simplifies the analysis of stochastic processes in financial modeling.",
        "The process D = (Dk)k=1,...,T, where Dk := Zk/Zk-1, is adapted, strictly positive, and satisfies EP[Dk|Fk-1] = 1, with Z being a P-martingale. The ratios Dk play the role of 'one-step conditional densities' of Q with respect to P, as shown in the Bayes formula (3.3): EQ[Uk | Fk-1] = EP[DkUk | Fk-1].",
        "Constructing EMM: Parametrization via (Zo, D): Constructing an equivalent martingale measure involves finding an Fo-measurable random variable Zo > 0 a.s. with Ep[Zo] = 1 and an adapted strictly positive process D = (Dk)k=1,...,T satisfying EP [Dk|Fk\u22121] = 1 for all k, ensuring the existence of a risk-neutral measure for pricing and hedging.",
        "In a setting with i.i.d. returns under P, where S\u00b9 = \u03be\u00b9/\u0394\u2070, the Q-martingale condition in multiplicative form is given by 1 = EQ[Sk/Sk\u22121 | Fk\u22121] = EP[DkYk/(1+r) | Fk\u22121], linking the one-step conditional densities Dk with the returns Yk."
