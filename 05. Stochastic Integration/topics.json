        "Stochastic integrals are foundational for describing trading gains/losses from self-financing strategies, extending discrete-time theory to continuous time. In this context, G(v) = \u222bv dS = \u2211v\u1d62\u0394S\u1d62 = \u2211v\u1d62(S\u1d62 - S\u1d62\u208b\u2081) represents these gains/losses, where v is the trading strategy and S is the asset price. Continuous-time stochastic integrals are constructed by approximating Riemann sums (\u2211 v(t\u1d62)(S(t\u1d62\u208a\u2081) - S(t\u1d62))), but this approach faces challenges when the integrator, like Brownian motion, lacks finite variation, necessitating alternative techniques.",
        "Defining stochastic integrals pathwise (\u03c9 by \u03c9) is possible if the integrator S and integrand v are suitably matched, even without finite variation. It\u00f4's formula exemplifies this, where v = g(S\u209c\u208b)dt for some C\u00b9-function g.",
        "In stochastic integrals, the evaluation point t\u1d62 within [t\u1d62, t\u1d62\u208a\u2081] is crucial. Choosing the left endpoint t\u1d62 yields the It\u00f4 integral, the right endpoint t\u1d62\u208a\u2081 the forward integral, and the midpoint (t\u1d62 + t\u1d62\u208a\u2081)/2 the Stratonovich integral. For financial applications, the It\u00f4 integral is preferred because the trading strategy must be decided before the price move, reflecting the causal structure of trading decisions.",
