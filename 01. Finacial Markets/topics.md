**1. Financial Markets in Finite Discrete Time**

   **1.1 Basic probabilistic concepts**
*   **Probability Space (Ω, F, P):** The fundamental structure for modeling uncertainty in financial markets, including the sample space, events, and probability measures.
*   **Filtration (IF = (Fk)k=0,1,...,T):** The increasing family of σ-fields representing the flow of information over time, making more information available at each subsequent step.
*   **Adapted Stochastic Process (X = (Xk)k=0,1,...,T):** A sequence of random variables where each Xk is measurable with respect to Fk, meaning that the value of Xk is observable at time k.
*   **Predictable Stochastic Process:**  A sequence of random variables where each Xk is measurable with respect to Fk-1, meaning that the value of Xk is known before time k. This distinction is key for modeling trading strategies.
*   **Measurability:** The concept of σ-algebras allowing the formal definition of what is "observable" at a particular time point, which is crucial in defining adaptedness and predictability.

   **1.2. Example (multiplicative model)**
*   **Multiplicative Model:** A model where asset prices are updated using multiplicative factors, including interest rate and growth factors (e.g., returns).
*  **Interest rate (rk):** The factor that influences the growth of the risk-free bank account and its Fk-1-measurability is crucial for predictability.
*  **Growth Factor (Yk):** The random variable that influences the change in stock prices, it is the core concept behind the stochasticity of the model.
*   **Filtration Generated by Y:** The standard filtration choice in this multiplicative model, where the information flow is based solely on the observed stock growth factors.
*   **Adaptedness to Generated Filtration:** How the stock prices, based on past growth factors, align with the generated filtration, implying that the prices are known at the time step.

    **1.3. Example (binomial model)**
*   **Binomial Model:**  A simplified market model with a constant interest rate and a stock price that can move up or down by predefined factors.
*   **Identically Distributed Returns (Yk):** The premise that stock returns are identically distributed (with a two-point distribution) introduces the concept of stochastic process stationarity.
*   **Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR) model**: The specific setup of the binomial model with independent returns and two possible outcomes at each step.

    **1.4. Remark 1.1**
*   **Filtration Generated by Y and r:** The concept of using the interest rate process in addition to the stock growth process to generate the information flow of the model.
*   **Relationship between Filtrations (F' ⊇ Fk):** The discussion on how an information flow incorporating interest rates compares to one that only contains stock prices, which is important for information-based modeling.

   **1.2 Financial markets and trading**

*   **Reference Asset (Ñº):** A strictly positive adapted stochastic process representing a benchmark against which other assets are measured and whose discounted value is 1, it allows simplifications in the model.
*   **Risky Assets (S = (S¹,..., Sd)):** A vector of adapted processes that represent the assets, and whose prices are stochastic.
*   **Discounting with Numeraire:** The transformation of asset prices to a new unit of account (the numeraire), and how it creates a zero-interest environment.
*   **Frictionless Financial Market:** The assumption that trades can be executed without costs or limitations and have no impact on the market price, crucial for the model's tractability.
*   **Tradeable Assets:** While there are only 'd' risky assets, the model allows for trading d+1 assets, when the reference asset is considered.

   **1.3 Definition of Trading Strategy**

*   **Trading Strategy (φ = (φº, θ)):**  A stochastic process describing how many units of the bank account (φº) and risky assets (θ) are held at each time, it is the core of the modeling framework for trading behavior.
*   **Predictability of Risk Asset Holdings (θ):** The concept that trading decisions based on the risky assets should be taken before the price change, and how this is represented using Fk-1-measurability.
*   **Adaptation of Bank Account Holdings (φº):** The relaxation on the bank account holdings allowing for them to be adapted to the information flow of the model.
*   **Discounted Value Process (V(φ)):** The value of the portfolio in units of the reference asset, a core concept for the analysis of trading strategies.
*   **Pre-trade Portfolio Value:** How the value process is seen as the state of the strategy right before prices are updated and how to make the distinction between pre and post trade values.

   **1.4 Analysis of Trading Costs**

*   **Incremental Cost (ACk+1(φ)):** The financial cost incurred in changing the strategy from time k to k+1 in terms of the discounted price.
*  **Book-keeping Identity:** The definition of the cost increments based only on financial book-keeping.
*   **Initial Cost (C0(φ)):** The initial investment in the reference asset, which is equivalent to the initial portfolio value.
*   **Stochastic Processes in the Equality:** The observation that variables in the model are in fact random variables (functions of ω), and thus equalities in the model must be understood as equalities between functions in ω.
*  **P-a.s. Equalities:** That the equalities do not need to be true for all ω, and that the model allows for exceptional cases with probability 0.
*   **Increment of a stochastic process ΔX:** How we define the difference between two subsequent time steps, a common way to study the variations in stochastic processes.
* **Rewriting of the incremental cost:** How to write the incremental cost from the changes in portfolio value and the losses from the risky assets.
* **Gains Process:** The process that captures the gains or losses of a trading strategy due to changes in the risky assets prices.
*   **Cost Process (C(φ)):** The process that represents the amount spent on implementing the trading strategy.

   **1.5 Self-Financing Strategies**

*   **Self-Financing Condition:** The condition for a strategy to have zero net cost, meaning that the changes in the portfolio are only funded with gains from other assets in the portfolio.
*   **Self-financing strategies as a cost-neutral rebalancing of portfolio:** The interpretation of self-financing as being achieved by only rearranging the weights of the portfolio among the existing assets.
*   **Equivalent Formulations of Self-Financing:** Different ways of expressing the self-financing requirement, and its implications to the value and gains processes of a strategy.
*   **Uniqueness of Self-Financing Strategies:** How an initial wealth and a risky asset strategy uniquely determine a self-financing trading strategy.
*  **Predictability of the bank account holdings in self-financing strategies:** How self financing leads to a predictable process in the bank account strategy.
*   **Numeraire Invariance:** The notion that the self-financing property does not depend on the units of the reference asset, i.e. if expressed in discounted or original units.

   **1.6 Examples**

*   **Stopping Time (τ):**  A random variable that satisfies the measurability condition {τ ≤ j} ∈ Fj, meaning that it is predictable in nature.
*   **Stopped Process (Sτ):** The process where asset prices are observed up to a stopping time, it is a core concept in many financial models.
*   **Measurability Issues of Stopped Process:** The discussion on the measurability conditions needed to ensure that a stopped process is still a valid stochastic process.
*   **Financial Relevance of the Stopping Time:** The intuition that strategies based on a time that depends on the future should not be allowed for predictable trading.
*   **Doubling Strategy:** A strategy where the investment on the risky asset is doubled until there is a positive price jump.
*  **Doubling Strategy analysis:** How to apply the developed concepts of gains process, value process and self-financing to analyze the behavior of the doubling strategy.
*   **Credit Line of Admissible Strategies:** The interpretation that admissible strategies have a limit on the amount of debt they can take.
*   **Time-Horizon and Admissibility:** The discussion on how infinite time-horizons or continuous time models imply the necessity of defining constraints on the trading strategies.
* **Numeraire Invariance of Admissibility:** The notion that admissibility is not invariant if we change the reference asset since it is defined based on discounted values, and how this is a pitfall in mathematical finance.

  **1.7 Martingale Results**

*   **Martingale Property (EQ[Xl|Fk] = Xk):** The concept that the best prediction of a future value is its current value, a foundational concept in mathematical finance.
