        "Semimartingales are stochastic processes represented as X = X0 + M + A, where M is a local martingale null at 0, indicating no initial uncertainty, and A is an adapted process null at 0 with right-continuous left limit (RCLL) trajectories of finite variation, signifying predictable changes. This forms a foundational concept in stochastic calculus.",
        "Quadratic variation of a process A, denoted as [A]t, quantifies the cumulative squared jumps of A over time, calculated as the limit of the sum of squared differences of A over a partition of the interval [0, t], reflecting the process's volatility and discontinuous behavior. It plays a crucial role in defining It\u00f4 integrals and understanding the behavior of stochastic processes.",
        "It\u00f4's Formula extends the chain rule to stochastic calculus, expressing the transformation of a semimartingale f(X) as f(Xt) = f(X0) + integral(f'(Xs) dXs) + 1/2 integral(f''(Xs) d<X>s), incorporating a second-order term that accounts for the quadratic variation of the process X, crucial for pricing derivatives and managing risk. The financial relevance of It\u00f4's formula lies in modeling the reaction of a new product Y = f(X) to changes in an underlying asset X, accounting for the second-order behavior via the quadratic variation. In differential notation, It\u00f4's formula is expressed as df(Xt) = f'(Xt) dXt + (1/2)f''(Xt) d[X]t, where d[X]t represents the quadratic variation of the process X, accounting for the second-order behavior of stochastic processes in financial models.",
        "The stochastic exponential E(X) of a semimartingale X is defined as the unique solution Z to the stochastic differential equation dZt = Zt- dXt with Z0 = 1, representing the accumulated effect of X over time and used in constructing hedging strategies and pricing exotic options. It can be expressed explicitly as E(X) = exp(X - 0.5<X>) when X is continuous, linking SDEs to exponential representations.",
        "Girsanov's Theorem provides a method for changing the probability measure under which a stochastic process is a martingale, stating that if M is a local P-martingale, then M\u0303 = M - integral((1/Z) d[Z, M]) is a local Q-martingale, where Z is the density process of Q with respect to P, enabling risk-neutral pricing and hedging in incomplete markets.",

        "Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) is the solution to the stochastic differential equation dS = \u03bcSdt + \u03c3SdW, modeling asset prices with drift \u03bc and volatility \u03c3, and is fundamental in option pricing. It is often used to model asset prices, defined as S_t = S_0 * exp((mu - 0.5*sigma^2)*t + sigma*W_t), where W_t is a Brownian motion, \u03bc is the drift, and \u03c3 is the volatility."

        "Girsanov's theorem demonstrates the invariance of the semimartingale property under equivalent probability measures, essential for changing the drift of a stochastic process to price derivatives in a risk-neutral framework. Girsanov's Theorem allows for a change of measure from P to Q, under which a local P-martingale M becomes a local Q-martingale M\u0303, by subtracting a term involving the covariation of M with the density process Z, facilitating the pricing of assets under different probability measures.",
        "The density process Z_t = dQ/dP | F_t represents the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the new measure Q with respect to the original measure P, and is a key component in transforming martingales via Girsanov's theorem. The density process Z in Girsanov's Theorem relates the probability measures P and Q, such that dQ = ZT dP, where ZT is the value of the density process at time T, enabling the transformation of stochastic processes under different probability assumptions.",

Girsanov's theorem provides a way to change the drift of a Brownian motion W under a new measure Q, where dW = dW + v dt, with v being a predictable process, essential in risk-neutral pricing.",

The process of constructing an equivalent martingale measure involves finding a process L such that S becomes a local Q-martingale, which is crucial for pricing assets under a risk-neutral measure.",
        "The Novikov condition, E[exp(1/2 \u222b hL, L iT)] < \u221e, ensures that the stochastic exponential E(L) is a true martingale, which is a necessary condition for defining a valid change of measure using Girsanov's Theorem. The Novikov condition, E[exp(0.5<L>_T)] < \u221e, is a sufficient condition for the stochastic exponential E(L) to be a true martingale, ensuring that the change of measure is well-behaved over the time interval [0, T].",

        "The stochastic exponential E(L) of a local P-martingale L is defined as the unique solution Z to dZ = Z_dL, with Z0 = 1, where L is also called the stochastic logarithm of Z, used in Girsanov transformations. Under Girsanov's theorem, if M is a local P-martingale, then M' = M - <L, M> is a local Q-martingale, where L is the stochastic logarithm of the density process Z, and <L, M> is their quadratic covariation."
